# Measurement Infrastructure for Distributed communicAtion and Sensing 

![](./state-14-09-2020.jpg)

Versatile is the project name encompassing all hardware, software and infrastructure.
MIDAS consists of a data acquisition and processing equipment backbone and a fine-grained network
of dispersed edge computing devices, radios, sensors, and LED sources that collectively function as a
massive, distributed resource. The equipment will enable the experimental testing and validation of
our research on new and entangled communication, lighting, security, and legal paradigms.

## Edge devices

140 Tiles equipped with:
- PoE+ (90W)
- Ethernet
- Precise Time Protocol
- Raspberry Pi 4 (processing unit) 

Communication/Sensing:
- USRP B210
- Acoustic (& ultra-sound)



## Server infrastructure
TBD
