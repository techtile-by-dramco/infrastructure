# MIDAS Infrastructure

Versatile is the project name encompassing all hardware, software and infrastructure.
MIDAS consists of a data acquisition and processing equipment backbone and a fine-grained network
of dispersed edge computing devices, radios, sensors, and LED sources that collectively function as a
massive, distributed resource. The equipment will enable the experimental testing and validation of
our research on new and entangled communication, lighting, security, and legal paradigms.
